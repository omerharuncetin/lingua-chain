how to deploy and update the protocol

Main contracts:
- Hub
- Registries
  - Passports
  - ID cards

Hub and Registries are following an upgradeable proxy pattern.
Use only the Proxy address for everything.

Secondary contracts:
- vc_and_disclose verifiers
- vc_and_disclose_id verifiers
- register verifiers'
- register id verifiers
- dsc verifiers

yarn deploy:hub:v2
```

```
